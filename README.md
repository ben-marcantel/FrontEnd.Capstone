# Java Lamp

This application is my capstone project for my first three months at Nashville Software School. It is a culmination of my studies in javascript,the angular js framework, and my personal explorations in the HTML canvas element. Users can manipulate various fields to create and save images.

## Built using

All images are equation based pixel expressions. This app is moslty built on vanilla javascript. The user field manipulations are combinations of home-brewed equations and functions. My goal was to present a simple but expressive system for creating images. Once a user has dialed in a theme and saved a parameter set, the user can easily create multiple variations.
